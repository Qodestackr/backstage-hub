There are many databases. Such as:

- Postgres for SQL/ Relational
- MongoDB: Document DBs
- Redis: covered in caching section
<!-- - InfluxDB : Time series -->
- Cassandra: Column based

- Firebase

My focus will be to learn not only the database itself but also the architecture around its type. That is to say:

- I will learn Postgres to understand it and relational models
- I will learn Cassandra to understand column-based DBs

I will learn database design atleast in a few for each of this. From there, I can focus on:

- Efficiency: Speed, Transactions, Reliability(persistence)
- Scale
